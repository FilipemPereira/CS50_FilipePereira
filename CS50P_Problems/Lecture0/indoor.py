'''
Implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted
unchanged. You're welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.
'''

# input - Ask to the user for an input
# print - print in the stdout (standard output) the message from input in lowercase
print(input().lower())
