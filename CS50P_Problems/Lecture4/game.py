"""
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100â€¦ ! Implement a programa that radom a number between 1 and n randomly. 

If the guess is smaller than that integer, the program should output Too small! and prompt the user again.
If the guess is larger than that integer, the program should output Too large! and prompt the user again.
If the guess is the same as that integer, the program should output Just right! and exit.
