In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a 
floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume that the user's input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space
between y and z, wherein:
x is an integer, y is a operator symbol and z is an integer too.
