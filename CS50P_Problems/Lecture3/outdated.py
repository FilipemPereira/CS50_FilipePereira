"""
In the United States, dates are typically formatted in month-day-year order (MM/DD/YYYY), otherwise known as middle-endian order, which is arguably bad 
design. Dates in that format can't be easily sorted because the date's year comes last instead of first. Try sorting, for instance, 2/2/1800, 3/3/1900, 
and 1/1/2000 chronologically in any program (e.g., a spreadsheet). Dates in that format are also ambiguous. Harvard was founded on September 8, 1636, but 
9/8/1636 could also be interpreted as August 9, 1636!

Implement a program that prompts the user for a date, anno Domini, in month-day-year order, formatted like 9/8/1636 or September 8, 1636, wherein the month
in the latter might be any of the values in the list with the months' names
